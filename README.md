# particleWorld
An ongoing art/code project exploring particle interactions. Written in C++ for the Cinder library (http://libcinder.org)

## Installation/Running
* The xcode/build/Release/ folder (probably) contains the newest compiled version of the app.
* The code compiles and runs under the newest version of xcode, and cinder release version 0.9
* I added the necessary VS2013 project files. However as of 5/11/16 the particles vanish from the screen after a short time.

## Videos + Other projects
Videos & gif's of various stages of the project, along with a variety of my personal work can be found [HERE](http://sleepyninjastudio.tumblr.com)
